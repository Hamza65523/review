1,"Absolutely outstanding food once again, friendly atmosphere and the bar staff was welcoming and even started singing happy birthday to me, fantastic service Visited here a couple of times but decided to have an evening meal here.Staff super friendly and we were the only ones in the restaurant.All food was delicious! We opted for salmon noodle stir fry, curry and the chicken stack. Only suggestion would be the noodles could have had some sort of sauce in them.But thank you for a lovely evening, we will be back! First visit and nice welcome. Good choice of beers and ales. We did not dine . Very cosy on a cold ,rainy day to sit near a warm fire. Really enjoyed our visit . Recommend. This was just a ten minute walk from our hotel. Not many seats inside so might be best to book ahead. Lovely staff. On the night we visited there were locals and holidaymakers eating. Food reasonably priced, good quality and well cooked and presented. My husband said it was the best steak he had eaten for a long time! Sadly his comment includes my cooking hahaha We were driving through St Clears and decided to stop for lunch and a drink.So glad we did!Really lovely lunch , I had tuna salad and my husband had cheese ploughmanâ€™s- we thoroughly enjoyed it and very generous portions.The landlord is very welcoming and friendly.Highly recommend! We were looking for somewhere to have an evening meal when we found Corvus. The lass who greeted us made us feel very welcome. The menu offered a decent choice and our meals were excellent.  We would happily come back. Visited on Wednesday evening, had to wait abit for a table, which is a good sign in my eyes.Served by two lovely girls who looked after us very well.The food was perfectly cooked and fresh to order. My steak was cooked to perfection and beautifully tender.You get a full happy plate of food, I would recommend a visit.Booking is advised in busy times. Visited the Corvus Inn for the first time yesterday.  Wow! I had an excellent lasagne with garlic bread....best ever! The Beer Garden was well kitted out for a Welsh summer too.Highly recommended. Called on a Tuesday night , lovely welcome from the girls behind the bar. Food arrived promptly.Best Gammon I have ever tasted, home made chips, husband had the hunters chicken, both meals excellent value for money. Lots of local people have recommended the Corvus, and they were spot on .Wonderful to see a local pub, serving such homely food. Thank you Lovely old pub serving a wide range of English, Welsh and international dishes. Attentive staff and prompt service. "
